#    It is a parameters file for GADMA software.

#    Lines started from # are ignored.
#    Also comments at the end of a line are ignored too.
#    Every line contains: Identificator of parameter : value.

#!!!     means pay attention to this parameter, they are primary.

#    Output directory to write all GADMA out.
#    One need to set it to a missing or empty directory.
#    If it is resumed from other directory and output directory 
#    isn't set, GADMA will add '_resumed' for previous output 
#    directory.
